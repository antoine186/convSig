\title{Read vcf files and processes them / User correct assembly}
\usage{
vcf2mut(datapath, geno = "GT", assembly, numbase, nb_chrom)
}
\arguments{
\item{datapath}{The path leading to your vcf file.}

\item{geno}{An ID Format string in your vcf file indicating the index of the
genotype information.}

\item{assembly}{The path leading to your assembly file (.fa or .fa.gz).}

\item{numbase}{An integer variable. A value of \code{5} will lead to the function
scanning the input files for 5 bases mutation signatures as opposed to 3 bases
signatures. a value of \code{3} causes the function to scan for 3 bases signatures.}

\item{nb_chrom}{The number of chromosomes to be processed in the input mutation
file.}
}
\value{
Write this after testing.
